  abstract = {In medicine and health care there are a lot of situations when patients
	have to be scheduled on different devices and/or with different physicians
	or therapists. It may concern preventive examinations, laboratory
	tests or convalescent therapies, therefore we are always looking
	for an optimal schedule that would result in finishing all the activities
	scheduled as soon as possible, with the least patient waiting time
	and maximum device utilization. Since patient scheduling is a highly
	complex problem, it is impossible to make a qualitative schedule
	by hand or even with exact heuristic methods. Therefore we developed
	a powerful automated scheduling method for highly constrained situations
	based on genetic algorithms and machine learning. In this paper we
	present the method, together with the whole process of schedule generation,
	the important parameters to direct the evolution and how the algorithm
	is guaranteed to produce only feasible solutions, not breaking any
	of the required constraints. We applied the described method to a
	problem of scheduling patients with different therapy needs to a
	limited number of therapeutic devices, but the algorithm can be easily
	modified for use in similar situations. The results are quite encouraging
	and since all the solutions are feasible, the method can be easily
	incorporated into an interactive user interface, which can be of
	major importance when scheduling patients, and human resources in
	general, is considered.},

volume = {22},

abstract = {Pre-hospital and emergency services in Indonesia are still developing. Despite recent improvements in the Indonesian healthcare system, issues with the provision of pre-hospital and emergency services persist. The demand for pre-hospital and emergency services has not been the subject of previous research and, therefore, has not been fully understood. Our research explored the utilization of emergency medical services by patients attending hospital emergency departments in Jakarta, Indonesia.
The study used a cross-sectional survey design involving five general hospitals (four government-funded and one private). Each patient's demographic profile, medical conditions, time to treatment, and mode of transport to reach the hospital were analysed using descriptive statistics.
A total of 1964 (62%) patients were surveyed. The median age of patients was 44 years with an interquartile range (IQR) of 26 to 58 years. Life-threatening conditions such as trauma and cardiovascular disease were found in 8.6 and 6.6% of patients, respectively. The majority of patients with trauma travelled to the hospital using a motorcycle or car (59.8%). An ambulance was used by only 9.3% of all patients and 38% of patients reported that they were not aware of the availability of ambulances. Ambulance response time was longer as compared to other modes of transportation (median: 24 minutes and IQR: 12 to 54 minutes). The longest time to treatment was experienced by patients with neurological disease, with a median time of 120 minutes (IQR: 78 to 270 minutes). Patients who used ambulances incurred higher costs as compared to those patients who did not use ambulances.
The low utilization of emergency ambulances in Jakarta could be contributed to patients' lack of awareness of medical symptoms and the existence of ambulance services, and patients' disinclination to use ambulances due to high costs and long response times. The emergency ambulance services can be improved by increasing population awareness on symptoms that warrant the use of ambulances and reducing the cost burden related to ambulance use.},

abstract = {Keywords: combinatorial optimization; global optimization; importance sampling; markov chain monte carlo; simulated annealing; simulation We present a new and fast method, called the cross-entropy method, for finding the optimal solution of combinatorial and continuous nonconvex optimization problems with convex bounded domains. To find the optimal solution we solve a sequence of simple auxiliary smooth optimization problems based on Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy, importance sampling, Markov chain and Boltzmann distribution. We use importance sampling as an important ingredient for adaptive adjustment of the temperature in the Boltzmann distribution and use Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy to find the optimal solution. In fact, we use the mode of a unimodal importance sampling distribution, like the mode of beta distribution, as an estimate of the optimal solution for continuous optimization and Markov chains approach for combinatorial optimization. In the later case we show almost surely convergence of our algorithm to the optimal solution. Supporting numerical results for both continuous and combinatorial optimization problems are given as well. Our empirical studies suggest that the cross-entropy method has polynomial in the size of the problem running time complexity. Article History: Registration Date: 15/10/2004},

    abstract = { IntroductionAmbulance service design is often reminiscent of the economic status of a country, with pre-hospital care in low to medium income countries relying on basic life support services and an historical ‘swoop and scoop’ Anglo-American emergency medical service model. The connection between pre-hospital intervention and patient outcome in low to medium income countries is unclear. This scoping study undertook an examination of the literature to establish the level and quality of patient care data collection, especially as it impacts ambulance case times in Malaysia and Indonesia.MethodsA scoping review methodology with topic specific keywords including ‘ambulance’, ‘emergency medical service’, ‘pre-hospital’ (and their variants) using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane and EMBase databases was used.ResultsOf the 202 articles returned, 185 were screened, 85 full text articles were reviewed for relevance. Forty-three publications were included in the study with a number of other relevant from the grey literature.ConclusionThe scoping study found there is no consistency in data collection methods in Indonesian or Malaysia, with some organisations collecting high quality data while others do not collect pre-hospital data. The study recommends deeper investigation into the status of standardisation of emergency medical services in the two countries and the manner in which the data is reported. }
